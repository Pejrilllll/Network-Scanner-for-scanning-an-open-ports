This is a simple **network scanner** tool built with Python. It is designed to scan a target host to detect **open ports** and **running services**, similar to a mini version of Nmap.  

A network scanner is commonly used to:
- Identify active hosts in a network  
- Discover open ports  
- Detect basic services running on those ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)  

**Purpose:** Educational use, networking practice, and basic reconnaissance in a safe environment.
